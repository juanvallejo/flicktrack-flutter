# flicktrack

Re-implementation of the Flicktrack frontend in Flutter.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Visual Studio Code Setup

Search for, and install the first few 'flutter' extensions in Visual Studio Code.
These will help navigate around the app, and debug.

Follow the following links to setup this project on vscode:
https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/editor?tab=vscode
https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/test-drive?tab=vscode

Skip to the "Run the app" section on the second link to see how to
run this app / debug using Visual Studio Code.

A chrome browser with the app and live reload should show up.

The app's "main" file itself can be found under `./lib/main.dart`.
Any changes made to this file will immediately reflect on the open
app in Chrome.
